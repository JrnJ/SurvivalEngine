// KeyInput
1. If GetKeyDown method is called twice within the same frame it will say false to every call after the first one
Fix => Give every call its own reference so that a different call will ask his own state
Problem => The sollution might result into memory leaking if key is never finished or free'ed in game

// ResizeSystem
1. Resizing not properly changing position after batch render system
Fix => Change all positions of quads based on screen resizeing.
Problem => Might take more than a 5.14 frames
